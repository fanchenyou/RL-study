To generate plots based on pre-trained network:
- Open file "Visualization.ipynb" and run all cells

To train network based on default parameters:
- Open file "Training.ipynb" and run cell with appropiate parameters
- Open file "Visualization.ipynb"
- Change variable net_file_name to the designated file name of Action Network
- Run all cells to generate plots
