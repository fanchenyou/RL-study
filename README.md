#### 2. Bandit problem, [ref](https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents/blob/master/Contextual-Policy.ipynb)
    * Bandit problem
    * Train a neural network to learn a policy for picking actions using feedback from the environment
    * Use policy gradients to adjust NN's weights through gradient descent
    * Re-written in Pytorch 1.2

#### 3. Modeling environment, [ref](https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents/blob/master/Contextual-Policy.ipynb)
    * Add separate network to model physical environment
    * Use policy gradients to adjust NN's weights through gradient descent
    * Re-written in Pytorch 1.2
